# Contributing Guidelines

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit just the modifications, do not mess with the CHANGELOG.md files.
* Ensure your code is nicely formatted style.
* Send the pull request.
